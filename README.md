Get cost information relating to external systems your Airflow pipelines interact with. This helps you attribute cost across different levels of granularity, from the individual task-level up to data product-level in Astro Observe.

Setup

You'll find the cost attribution DAGs in the dags folder. We currently support Snowflake, with plans to expand and support other data warehouses.
